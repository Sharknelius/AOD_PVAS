Place [fileName].mp4 in directory:
"AOD_PVAS\YOLO11-Object-Tracking\ultralytics\models\yolo\detect"

Update the model being tested in "runTracker.py"
Run this command in a terminal within the same directory:
"python runTracker.py"

Update the model being tested in "testModel.py"
That may not be working right now, so try:
"python testModel.py"
